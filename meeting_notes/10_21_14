Lab Access in AIC 152

Tasks needed to proceed with experiment:

1.) Introduce audio instructions to the simulation based on the word document availabe in git. 

2.) Find a way to get coordinates (x, y, possibly z) of actual and proposed (by subject) locations for objects. 

3.) Implement some kind of confidence reading after each selection

4.) Implement distractor task; needs to be 2 min. in duration.

5.) Map space to a 2d image, no objects, empty room. Would be nice to get this mapping done after objects
are placed with actual/proposed placements

6.) Add some kind of texture to the walls for realism
